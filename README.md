## API Report

### API Selection and Implementation

The REST Countries API was chosen for this project due to its comprehensive data about countries worldwide and its well-documented, reliable endpoints. The application uses the following endpoints:

1. **GET /all**
   - Used to fetch the initial list of all countries
   - Data is cached to improve performance on subsequent visits

2. **GET /name/{name}**
   - Implements real-time search functionality
   - Debouncing is applied to minimize API calls during typing

3. **GET /region/{region}**
   - Allows filtering countries by continental regions
   - Combined with client-side filtering for optimal user experience

4. **GET /alpha/{code}**
   - Retrieves detailed information for individual country pages
   - Includes additional data not available in the basic country list

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Managing large datasets returned by the API
   - **Solution**: Implemented pagination and lazy loading to improve performance and reduce initial load time

2. **Challenge**: Handling inconsistent data formats across different countries
   - **Solution**: Created normalization functions that standardize data before displaying it to the user, ensuring a consistent user experience regardless of data variations

3. **Challenge**: Implementing efficient search across multiple attributes
   - **Solution**: Developed a client-side search algorithm that filters already-fetched countries when possible, falling back to API search for more comprehensive queries

4. **Challenge**: Maintaining responsive design across various screen sizes
   - **Solution**: Used Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes and custom media queries to ensure the application looks good on devices from mobile phones to large desktop screens

5. **Challenge**: Implementing secure user authentication
   - **Solution**: Created a separate authentication service with JWT tokens and secure storage, implementing proper token refresh mechanisms and session timeout handling
